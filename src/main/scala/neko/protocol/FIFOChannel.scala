/**
 * Implements multi-party FIFO channels.
 *
 * The protocol ensures that all messages sent from a process p to a process q are delivered by q
 * in the same order they were sent by p.
 *
 * The protocol is not thread-safe if each process has more than one send thread
 * or more than one receive thread. Fortunately, this is the case as long as each
 * [[neko.NekoProcess]] has only one protocol [[neko.ActiveProtocol]] and doesn't use
 * timers, which is the most common case for examples used in the lecture I445. A real-world
 * implementation would however need to be made thread-safe.
 *
 * @param config   the process on which the protocol runs.
