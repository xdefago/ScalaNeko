/**
 * Support for protocols working in a model of anonymous rounds.
 *
 * The relevant signals are as follows:
 *
 *   - [[FastAnonymousRounds#InitRound]] is sent once at the beginning to start the initial round.
 *   - [[FastAnonymousRounds#StartRound]] is sent at the beginning of each round and indicates:
 *     - the round number
 *     - the information sent by the processes in the previous round. To distinguish the information
 *       sent by "me", a protocol must keep it in its own state.
 *   - [[FastAnonymousRounds#Done]] is sent by a protocol to indicate that the computation is
 *     finished.
 *
 * @param config   the process on which the protocol runs.
