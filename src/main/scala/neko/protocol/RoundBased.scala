/**
 * Support for round-based protocols.
 *
 * Round-based protocols start with an internal event [[neko.protocol.RoundBased.InitRound]], during which they
 * send exactly one message to each other process, including themselves. This can be done through
 * a broadcast, or through separate calls to [[neko.Receiving#SEND]].
 *
 * After that, each round starts with an internal event [[neko.protocol.RoundBased.StartRound]], which carries
 * the number of the round, as well as a set of messages (one from each of the processes), which
 * were sent during the previous round.
 *
 * @param config   the process on which the protocol runs.
