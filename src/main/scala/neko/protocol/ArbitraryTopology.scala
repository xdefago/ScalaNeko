/**
 * Support for simulating arbitrary network topologies.
 *
 * The topologyDescriptor is given as a graph
 * (see [[http://www.scala-graph.org/api/core/api/#scalax.collection.Graph]]).
 * A message sent by a process ''p''
 * is delivered to another process ''q'' only if ''q'' is a neighbor of ''p'' in the graph.
 * The protocol can also be queried through the [[neko.util.Topology]] trait, to obtain the set of neighbors
 *
 * By default, the topologyDescriptor is a clique of all the processes, but other ready-made graphs can also
 * be found in [[neko.util.Topology]].
 *
 * @param config         the process on which the protocol runs.
 * @param topology  a graph describing the whole network topologyDescriptor. A warning is issued when the graph is not connected.
