/**
 * handles the lockstep execution of registered concurrent activities
 * (protocol objects that implement the trait [[ManagedActivity]]).
 *
 * The activities are assumed to exchange information using a producer-consumer model such as
 * [[java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue]]. The model is not safe if the activity is actually be
 * made to wait on the queue (see details at the bottom).
 *
 * Initialization:
 *  1. new activities are registered by calling [[registerActivity]], which provides an identifier
 *     ([[ActivityID]]).
 *  1. after all activities have been registered, the activity manager is started [[start]].
 *  1. the activities are started just like normal threads.
 *
 * The lifecycle of an activity is as follows:
 *  1. upon starting, the activity first calls [[willStart]] once, and starts its concurrent
 *     execution as a thread.
 *  1. Each time the activity would be required to wait on a queue (checked by polling on the
 *     structure), it will instead wait through a call to [[willWait]], and proceed to do the
 *     blocking call only once it is sure that it will not be made to wait.
 *  1. Once the activity has finished its normal execution, it calls [[willFinish]] which blocks
 *     until all other threads have finished.
 *
 * After all activities started, the lockstep execution proceeds as follows:
 *  1. all activities execute concurrently until all of them are blocked on a call to [[willWait]]
 *     or [[willFinish]].
 *  1. the manager executes all registered actions (i.e., actions registered through
 *     [[registerAction]]) sequentially, and in mutual exclusion with the activities.
 *  1. after all actions have been executed once,
 *     the cycle repeats if some activity has called [[willWait]], or
 *     the cycle ends if all activities have called [[willFinish]].
 *
 * ===Additional notes on synchronization===
 *
 * As said before, activities can't be made to actually wait on a queue. This means that the queue
 * must provide a means for polling (such as [[java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue!.isEmpty]]), to
 * make sure that the thread will not actually be blocked by the queue. Practically speaking, this
 * means that:
 *  - some scala synchronization primitives like [[scala.concurrent.SyncVar]] or
 *    [[scala.concurrent.SyncChannel]] can't be used safely.
 *  - the queue can have only one consumer.
 *  - the queue must either be unbounded (e.g., [[java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue]] as
 *    used in the implementation of [[neko.ActiveProtocol]]) or it must have a reserved location
 *    for every producer activity.
