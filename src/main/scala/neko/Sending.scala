/**
 * Defines the behavior for a protocol that provides the sending of messages as capability.
 *
 * The trait is used to complement the functionality of an instance of [[ProtocolImpl]] by declaring
 * that the instance is capable to send a message through the network. Thus, it is usually used
 * together with [[Receiving]]. For instance,
 *
 * {{{
 *   class FIFOChannel (p: NekoProcess, nickname: String)
 *     extends ProtocolImpl(p, nickname)
 *       with Sending with Receiving
 *   {
 *     def onSend = { case ... }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * There are cases where this trait could be used without [[Receiving]], for instance, by a protocol
 * that would only record what it is sent to, without sending anything through the actual network.
 * This is however a very rare situation, and can safely be ignored as far as the lecture I445 is
 * concerned.
