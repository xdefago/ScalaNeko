/**
 * Basic trait to define all processable events in ScalaNeko.
 * There are two basic kinds of events:
 *
 * - Events that are internal to a given process and used as notifications across protocol layers
 *   are called "signals". Such events must inherit from the class [[Signal]], and are always local
 *   to the process on which they were created.
 *
 * - Events that eventually transit through a network are called "messages". Such events must
 *   inherit from one of the subclasses of [[Message]], namely:
 *   - [[UnicastMessage]] are for messages with a single destination process, that are generated by
 *     a protocol.
 *   - [[MulticastMessage]] are for messages with multiple destinations, that are generated by a
 *     protocol.
 *   - [[Wrapper]] are for wrapping existing messages with added information (e.g., a sequence
 *     number), as is typically done for payload messages. Even without adding new information, a
 *     typical use case is to ensure that the message will first be processed by the same protocol
 *     (at the destination process) before its content is delivered to the higher layer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note that all events must be immutable. It is an error to create mutable messages and, even
 * though this is not necessarily detected by the compiler, mutable messages will almost surely
 * lead to faulty behavior that is difficult to reproduce and thus will be extremely difficult to
 * detect.

/**

 * All messages used for signaling within a process should inherit from this class.
 * Just like other messages, a protocol must listen to it for an internal event to be delivered
 * successfully. Unlike messages, no error is raised in case there is no protocol to
 * listen to it.

 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   case object Terminate extends Signal
 *   case class ChangeID(id: Int) extends Signal

/**
 * Basic trait to define all messages. A message is an event that is supposed to propagate through
 * the network, and thus cross process boundaries.
 *
 * This superclass defines the basic information that every message must hold. It is not possible
 * to extend this class directly, but rather messages are defined by extending one of its four
 * subclasses: [[UnicastMessage]], [[MulticastMessage]], [[BroadcastMessage]], or [[Wrapper]].
 *
 * The choice of a parent class (among the three classes described above) depends on the nature of
 * the message to define.
 *
 *  - [[UnicastMessage]] is for a message that is generated by the protocol (typically a control
 *    message) and it makes no sense for that message to have multiple destinations (e.g., a token
 *    that circulates on a logical ring).
 *
 *  - [[MulticastMessage]] is for a message that is generated by the protocol and may have multiple
 *    destinations.
 *
 *  - [[BroadcastMessage]] is for a message that is generated by the protocol and is broadcast to all neighbors of
 *    sending process.
 *
 *  - [[Wrapper]] is for adding information to an existing message, typically obtained from the
 *    application (or a higher-level protocol). This occurs for instance, when our protocol needs
 *    to add sequence numbers or other similar information to an existing payload message.
 *
 * NB: Note that, just like other events, all instances of [[Message]] and their subclass must be
 * immutable. It is an error to define a mutable subclass or else behavior is undetermined.
